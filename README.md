Our goal at QRChain is to increase the transparency of the food supply chain.


The application is designed to allow participants to interact with the ingredient & product assets creating, updating and transferring them as their permissions allow. The participants included in the application are as follows:
| Participants | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| Farmer | Create, Read, Update (Own ingredients), Delete (Own ingredients)|
| Aggregator | Read (Own ingredients), Update (Batch) |
| Manufacturer | Read (Own Ingredients/Products), Create, Delete, Update (Own Products) |
| Vendor | Read (Owned Products)|
| Regulator | Read (Products & Ingredients)|







####Stages:####

Ingredient is created by the Farmer.
Ingredient is sold to the Aggregator.
Aggregator updates the ingredient with the batch information.
Aggregator then sells the updated ingredient to the Manufacturer. 
Manufacturer then takes the ingredient and/or other products to create their final product.
Manufacturer then sells final product to Vendor to be sold to the consumer. 
Regulator (FDA) would be able perform oversight over this whole process if needed.
